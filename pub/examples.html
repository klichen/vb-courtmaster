    <h1>Volleyball Rotations For Beginners</h1>
    <h3>Below you can see all 6 rotations that all players must go through during a volleyball match. 
        Depending on what position you play, follow a circle (i.e. if you are a setter, follow the setter circle across the six rotations) through each rotation to 
        get comfortable with them and don't forget to apply it during your games!
    </h3>
